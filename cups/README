README for cups 2.x.x

REQUIREMENTS

1. As of version 1.5 cups needs libusb to print to usb printers, the kernel
   modules usblp is no longer supported. 
   The port installs /etc/modprobe.de/cups.conf to blacklist the module.

   gutenprint port (formerly gimp-print) is recommended. HP DeskJet/LaserJet 
   users should install the hpcups port.
3. Build and install in the following order:
   - cups
   - ghostscript
   - cups-filters
   - gutenprint (optionally)
   - hpcups (optionally)

NOT you must generate a PPD file (Postscript Printer Description) for your 
printer:
