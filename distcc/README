POST-INSTALL:

To use distcc, just:
a) Set DISTCC_ALLOW=IPADDR[/MASK] to /etc/rc.conf.
b) Export DISTCC_HOSTS to include the compilation hosts.
c) Prepend /usr/lib/distcc to your $PATH environment variable.
   (e.g. in pkgmk.conf)
d) Export MAKEFLAGS=-j<n> where n is a number representing the number of
  	parallel jobs you want.
e) Optionally set DISTCC_LOG_LEVEL=LEVEL in /etc/rc.conf to be more or
	less verbose to syslogd.


DISTCCD SERVICE

There's a service to simplify running distccd. By default, it wont run without DISTCC_ALLOW=IPADDR[/MASK] to accept connections and runs as user 'nobody'. Both values can be overridden in /etc/rc.conf, like this:

----
DISTCC_ALLOW='192.168.1.0/24'
DISTCC_USER='pkgmk'
----

There is more information on the public wiki http://crux.nu/Public/HomePage
and in the man pages 'man distccd' and 'man distcc'.
