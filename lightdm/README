It is recommended that you put "UPGRADE ^usr/etc/.*$ NO"
into your /etc/pkgadd.conf, else the config will be overwritten 
during update!

You need to install a greeter for lightdm, you can find 
lightdm-mini-greeter in my REPO or you can use autologin for a 
singleuser session with PAM.

Update March 2019: accountsservice seems to harddepend on at least
elogind, I have deleted the dependency and I am thinking about
removing the port. If you have interest in taking it over, leave
me a message.
I am bumping the release because I am not sure if something could
break.
