# Part 1:

Please read up on the following ticket:
https://todo.sr.ht/~kaniini/pkgconf/1

The gist: since we exchange pkg-config for pkgconf here, this should not be a
problem, still, this is not 'nice'.

# Part 2:

#!/bin/sh
#
# This was originally my post-install for this port!
# pkgconf and pkg-config are not meant to co-exist, but
# the decision to swap them out is only yours to make! 
# Please review the consequences of this script!
