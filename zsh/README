PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION

    If you don't remove libpcre before building this port libpcre will
    be a runtime dependency of zsh. This is a problem on systems where
    zsh needs to be available at boot before the directory containing
    libpcre.so is mounted. The same applies to gdbm.so.

    To make the completion for prt-utils work, you have to update prt-get's
    cache after port or package db oprertions (e.g. ports -u, prt-get install
    xyz). The completion relies prt-utils' cache for performance reasons.

MISC
    zsh-lovers.1 is taken from http://www.grml.org/zsh/zsh-lovers.1
